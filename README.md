Gear selector fork design optimization for additive manufacturing through ALTAIR INSPIRE

## Project Overview

- Designed a **3D CAD model** using SOLIDWORKS.
- Applied **topology optimization** in **Altair Inspire 2022** with two objectives:
  - Minimize mass
  - Maximize stiffness
- Conducted simulations using **finite element analysis (FEA)** to evaluate stress distribution, displacement, and safety factors.
- Compared two materials: **AISI 4142** and **AISI 4130**, using the **Weighted Properties Method (WPM)** for material selection.
- Evaluated **additive manufacturing feasibility** using **Selective Laser Melting (SLM)** and benchmarked against conventional manufacturing methods.

## Tools & Methods

- **CAD Software**: SOLIDWORKS  
- **Topology Optimization & Simulation**: Altair Inspire, OptiStruct  
- **Material Selection**: Weighted Properties Method (WPM)  
- **Post-processing**: Mesh refinement, load application, symmetry controls, safety factor constraints  
- **AM Technology**: Selective Laser Melting (SLM)  
- **Economic Analysis**: Compared AM vs traditional methods, including machine costs, energy, and labor

## Results

- Achieved **~39.5% mass reduction** with maintained mechanical performance (FoS ≥ 2).
- Final displacement: **0.3–0.41 mm**, maximum stress: **~290 MPa**
- **AISI 4142** showed better structural performance than AISI 4130.
- Additive Manufacturing (SLM) was **more cost-efficient** for low production volumes (10 pcs) compared to conventional methods.
